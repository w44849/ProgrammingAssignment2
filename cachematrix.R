## The first function, makeCacheMatrix creates a special "matrix", which is really a list containing a function to
## 1. set the value of the matrix
## 2. get the value of the matrix
## 3. set the value of the solve
## 4. get the value of the solve

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
  m <- NULL
  set <- function(y) {
    x <<- y
    m <<- NULL
  }
  get <- function() x
  setsolve <- function(solve) m <<- solve
  getsolve <- function() m
  list(set = set, get = get,
       setsolve = setsolve,
       getsolve = getsolve)

}


## The following function calculates the solve of the special "matrix" created with the above function. 
## However, it first checks to see if the solve has already been calculated. 
## If so, it gets the mean from the cache and skips the computation. 
## Otherwise, it calculates the solve of the data and sets the value of the solve in the cache via the setsolve function.

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
  m <- x$getsolve()
  if(!is.null(m)) {
    message("getting cached data")
    return(m)
  }
  data <- x$get()
  m <- solve(data, ...)
  x$setsolve(m)
  m
## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
}
